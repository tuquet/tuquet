## What Happens During Installation

In approximately 15 seconds, the automated installer completes:

1. **Client Deployment**: Installs `tq` into user-space (`~/.tq/bin/`) without requiring administrator or root privileges.
2. **PATH Configuration**: Registers the command globally so you can run `tuquet` from any terminal or shell.
3. **Dedicated Antidetect Engine**: Provisions the optimized Antidetect Chromium LTS runtime.
4. **Environment Check**: Validates network tunnels and local storage directories.

## Verifying Your Installation
