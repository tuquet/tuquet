# Skills

A curated collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) reflecting Tuquet's engineering standards, quality benchmarks, and best practices for AI coding agents.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Built on top of an open-source architecture for keeping agent skills synchronized with upstream sources, Skills provides enterprise-grade runbooks and autonomous workflows across Google Antigravity, Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex.

## Installation

### Install via Skills CLI (Recommended)

To install all skills from this repository into your project, use the [skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI:

npx skills add tuquet/skills --skill='*'
```

Or install all of them globally for all projects on your workstation:

```bash
npx skills add tuquet/skills --skill='*' -g
```

Or install only agent

```bash
npx skills add tuquet/skills --agent antigravity --skill='*' -y
```

To install an individual skill:

```bash
npx skills add tuquet/skills --skill=vue

## Development & Maintenance

This repository utilizes Git Submodules in `sources/` to track upstream repositories directly:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Interactive CLI for submodule management
pnpm start

# 3. Synchronize all submodules & skills non-interactively
pnpm start sync
```
